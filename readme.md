# govuk-jekyll-template

This is an attempt by a data scientist masquerading as a web developer to style a Jekyll site with the styling elements from GOV.UK.

It is very much a work in progress. 

You can see the site as built by github at [/govuk-jekyll-template/](https://gillespied.github.io/govuk-jekyll-template/)

You should be able to recreate the environment by opening the container with vscode.

You will also need to edit the two parameters `baseurl` and `url` from `_config.yml`.

## To do

Write a script to download and make changes to the `.css` and `.js` files as they are updated. I did it by hand this time.
