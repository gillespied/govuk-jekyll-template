This is an attempt by a data-scientist maskerading as a web developer to style a jekyll site with the syling elements from gov.uk.

It is very much a work in progress. You can see the site as built by github here[/govuk-jekyll-template/](https://gillespied.github.io/govuk-jekyll-template/)

You should be able to recreate the environment by opening the container with vscode.

## To do

Write a script to download and make changes to the `.css` and `.js` files as they are updated. I did it by hand this time.
